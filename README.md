InteraConstruction: The Unity Zonstruction Zone Simulator

In the world of construction labour, workers need to be extremely mindful and cautious of their work environment; it is a profession that requires proper training. It has been reported that over 60% of workplace accidents involve individuals with less than 1 year of experience or who are unfamiliar with certain machinery. Workplace incidents include trips and falls from heights, being strucked being moving vehicles, collisions with falling objects, and more. Not only do these incidents severely affect workers, but businesses end up spending more capital on medical expenses, compensation, and project delays than they do on safety training.
  
With the recent push towards distanced education and training in other fields, InteraConstruction aims to provide a virtual environment for new workers to familiarize themselves with a project environment and some of the heavy machinery used in it; without the risk of injury to themselves or others present in a real-life scenario. By providing this tool as part of worker training programs, we aim to reduce the number of on-site incidents, damages, and medical expenses.
  
  The following is included in the scope of the project:
  
⊛ Trainees will be placed into a 3D Unity built virtual construction site, to be able to familiarize themselves with the environment. 

⊛ Interactable machinery and equipment will be within the virtual world, allowing trainees to realistically use them correctly and in a safe manner

⊛ Provide users with a tutorial on how to use the different machinery and equipment

⊛ Multiplayer capacilities, facilitating synchronous gameplay via custom servers (using Photon PUN)
